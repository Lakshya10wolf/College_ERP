# College-ERP-System
In this System, I use django for handling all the backend work and also using rest framework for validation and all.

There are three main modules :

      ->Viewing personal detail.
      ->Changing the user and Teacher detail.
      ->Providing attendance of teacher
      ->Viewing details of Student and Teacher.
      ->Editing Password.
      ->Providing Subjects.
      ->Viewing Feedback.
      ->Providing Notification.
